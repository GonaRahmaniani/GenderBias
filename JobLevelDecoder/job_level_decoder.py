#Intended use: help create training data for NLP model
#Takes CSV file full of eng or cs ads and classifies them as
#low, mid, or high level under a column 'Classification'
#if testing the accuracy of this program, set TESTING to True
#if testing this program, the CSV file should have a column
#'Human Classification' containing the correct job level classification
#when testing, program will print overall accuracy score
#and recall and precision scores for low, mid, and high levels
